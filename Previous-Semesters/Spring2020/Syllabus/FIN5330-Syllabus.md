## Syllabus

### Course Description

This course covers modern financial econometrics and data analysis. We will cover
predictive time series models as well as modern algorithmic models. We will 
cover applications to risk management and trading (among other topics). We will also
discuss modern developments such as how financial econometrics is influenced by and
interfaces with artificial intelligence and machine learning. 


### Prerequisites

- ECN 4330 or equivalent
- ***Strong economic and statistical logic***


### Textbooks

The _required_ textbooks are the following:

* [Analysis of Financial Data][Koop] by Gary Koop.

* [Scrum: The Art of Doing Twice the Work in Half the Time][Sutherlands] by Jeff and J.J. Sutherland 

Other books that we may draw from: 

* [Introduction to Statistical Learning][JWHT] by James, Witten, Hastie, and Tibshirani. 

* [Analysis of Financial Time Series - 3rd Edition][Tsay] by Ruey Tsay.

* [The Econometrics of Financial Markets][CLM] by Campbell, Lo, and MacKinlay.

* [Applied Econometric Time Series - 4th Edition][Enders] by Walter Enders. 


### Methods of Teaching and Learning

This course will be taught as a graduate seminar style course. That means that
your participation is crucial. You will get out of the course what you 
individually and collectively put in. 

Most lectures will consist of Jupyter notebooks and slides covering the 
material, though wherever possible I will use the Socratic method. 

One essential element of this course is project management using the
agile methodology of Scrum. The course consists of four projects. You 
will be placed into teams and the balance of the semester will be completing
the four projects as a team. I will the stakeholder to whom you will make
periodic update reports and ultimately the deliverables for the projects. More 
details will be given about this in class. 


### Assessment and Grading

Students will be assessed according to the following:

* Class Preparation, Participation and Citizenship (20%) - Much has been said about this already above. Let me just emphasize that no student can earn an A in the course who 
does not take this component of their grade seriously!

* Project I (20%) - Pairs trading and statistical arbitrage  

* Project II (20%) - Volatility models and predictive densities

* Project III (20%) - Tests of superior predictive ability (RC, SPA, StepM)

* Project IV (20%) - Implement and test an original dynamic trading strategy 


#### Slack

All class communication will take place using [Slack](https://slack.com), a messaging system that replaces email.
Students will be invited to the [Fin 5330 Slack channel](https://fin5330.slack.com) prior to the first week of
class.

Clients for most computing and mobile platforms can be
[downloaded from the Slack website](https://slack.com/downloads), or students may use the web client
via a desktop browser.


#### Programming

I will be presenting code in the Julia programming language throughout the 
course. Occasionally, I might present some code in Python or R. You are expected to 
complete your programming assignments and exams in one of these programming
languages. 


### Schedule of Topics


We will attempt to cover the following list of topics:

1. ___Module I___: Foundations: financial data, difference equations, programming, mathematics and statistics, Monte Carlo studies
2. ___Module II___: Linear time series analysis, volatility models, unit roots and cointegration 
3. ___Module III___: Multivariate time series models
4. ___Module IV___: Backtesting trading strategies, data snooping bias, and the bootstrap

***NB:*** I reserve the right to dynamically alter this list as the course progresses. I will announce any such changes in class and on the course Slack channel.
