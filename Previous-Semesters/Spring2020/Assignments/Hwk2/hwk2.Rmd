## __Problem 1__

<br>

1. Simulate $T = 500$ observations from an $AR(1)$ process for $\phi = \{0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0.8, 0.9\}$. 

   $$y_{t} = \phi y_{t-1} + \epsilon_{t}$$

2. Treat the artificial from the simulations above as observed data by an econometrician. 

3. Estimate each model via OLS.

4. Test the standard null hypothesis of $\phi = 0$ with a standard $t$-test for significance levels
  $\{0.01, 0.05, 0.10\}$ for each one and report the results in a table. Provide test statistics,
  standard errors, critical values, p-values, etc.

5. Pick one of the parameter values for the models above and do the following: 
    * Use the Central Limit Theorem to derivive a sampling distribution for $\hat{\phi}$. Present
      the parameter values of the sampling distribution. Produce a graph of the distribution.
    * Use parametric Monte Carlo to simulate the sampling distribution. Use $M = 10,000$ repititions.
      Use the sample mean and standard deviation to estimate the parameter values of the distribution.
      Produce a histogram.
    * Use the IID Bootstrap to simulate the sampling distribution. Use $B = 10,000$ repititions. 
      Use the sample mean and standard deviation to estimate the parameter values of the 
      distribution. Produce a histogram.
    * Compare all three methods. 
    * Can you interpret the last two distributions as predictive densities?

6. Return to the problem in 5 above and redo the simulation from step one, but replace the error distribution
   with a Student-T distribution with $df = 5$ (degrees of freedom parameter). Even though we know at the generation
   stage that the errors come from the Student-T distribution, the econometrician assumes a normal distribution when
   using the CLT and parametric Monte Carlo. The bootstrap obviously does not need to make such assumptions. Compare
   to the results above.

## __Problem 2__

Simulate an $AR(1)$ process with parameter $\phi = 0.8$ by using the $MA(\infty)$ representation. \textbf{Hint:} you will
have to truncate the $MA(\infty)$ representation, yielding an approximation to the $AR(1)$. Recall that the $AR(1)$ can be 
represented by the following (i.e. the $MA(\infty)$ representation): 

$$
x_{t} = x_{0} + \sum\limits_{j=0}^{\infty} \phi^{j} \varepsilon_{t-j} \quad\quad \mbox{where } x_{0} \mbox{ is the initial condition.}
$$


* Plot the simulated time series. 

* Estimate $\hat{\phi}$ via OLS. Report the usual suspects. 

<br>


## __Problem 3__

Take the $AR(1)$ model above: 

$$
y_{t} = \phi y_{t-1} + \varepsilon_{t} \quad\quad \mbox{with } \phi = 0.8
$$

* Run the following simulation: 
	- Set $\varepsilon_{0} = 1.0$
	- Set $y_{0} = 0.0$
	- Set all $\varepsilon_{t} = 0.0$ for $t > 0$ 
	- Plot the simulated process $\{y\}_{t=0}^{T}$ as a function of time. This is called the ___impluse response function___. Interpret
	  it in terms of the $MA$ ($\theta$) coefficients for the $AR(1)$ representation.
	- Simulate $T = 50$ time steps in the process.

<br>

## __Problem 5__

Simulate $T = 500$ observations from the following ARMA model:

$$
y_{t} = \phi_{1} y{t-1} + \phi_{2} y_{t-2} + \theta_{1} \varepsilon_{t-1} + \theta_{2} \varepsilon_{t-2} + \varepsilon_{t}
$$

Choose appropriate values for the $AR$ and $MA$ coefficients, as well as for $\sigma_{\varepsilon}$. 

<br>

* Plot the simulated time series. 

* Calculate $\gamma_{0}$, $\gamma_{1}$ and $\gamma_{2}$.

## __Problem 6__

- Simulate $T = 500$ time steps for the following two equations:

   $$\begin{aligned} y_{t} &= y_{t-1} + u_{1,t} \\ x_{t} &= x_{t-1} + u_{2,t} \end{aligned} $$

- where $u_{j,t} \quad j = 1,2$ are independent standard white noise processes.

- Next regress $y_{t}$ on $x_{t}$ and estimate $\beta$ (slope coefficient) via OLS in the following regression

   $$y_{t} = \alpha + \beta x_{t} + \epsilon_{t}$$

- Test the null hypothesis $H_{0}: \beta = 0$ against the alternative $H_{a}: \beta \ne 0$. Use the standard $t$-test
  with standard significance levels (0.01, 0.05, and 0.10). What should you find? What do you find?

- Repeat the process $M = 50,000$ times and store the $\beta$ coefficients for each run of the simulation. 

- Summarize the simulated sampling distribution for $\beta$. 

- Make a histogram plot of the simulated coefficients.

## __Problem 7__

<br>

- Repeat the exercise in Problem 1 above for $\phi = 1.0$.

- Comment on your findings.

<br>

## __Problem 8__

<br>

- Simulate $T = 500$ time steps from the random walk model 
  
	$$x_{t} = x_{t-1} + u_{1,t}$$

- Next simulate $T = 500$ time steps from the model 

	$$y_{t} = \alpha + \beta x_{t} + \epsilon_{t}$$

- Where $\alpha = 0.22$ and $\beta = 2.50$. 

- $\epsilon \sim N(0,1)$ (white noise process)

- Use the Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test to check for the presence of a unit-root in both $y_{t}$ and $x_{t}$. What do you find? What should
  you find? 

- Implement the Engle-Granger two-step method by:
	- First, test for cointegration by submitting $\hat{\epsilon}_{t}$ to the ADF Test. What do you find?
	- Obtain $\hat{\beta}$ via OLS. 
	- Estimate the error-correction model with $p = 1$ and include contemporaneous $x_{t}$.
