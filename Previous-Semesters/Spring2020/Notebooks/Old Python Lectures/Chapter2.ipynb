    "Strict stationarity requires that the joint distribution of $(r_{t_{1} + t}, \\ldots, r_{t_{k} + t})$ is invariant under time shift. This is a very strong requirement that is challenging to verify empirically. For this reason, we often employ a simpler form of stationarity. \n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "A time series is $\\{r_{t}\\}$ _weakly stationary_ if both the mean of $r_{t}$ and the covariance between $r_{t}$ and $r_{t-l}$ are time invariant, where $l$ is an arbitrary integer.\n",

Weak stationarity implies that a time plot of the data would show that the $T$ values fluctuate with constant variation around a fixed level. In application, weak stationarity enables one to make inference concerning future observations (e.g. prediction).\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Implicitly, in the condition of weak stationarity, we assume that the first two moments of $r_{t}$ are finite. From the definitions, if $r_{t}$ is strictly stationary and its first two moments are finite, then $r_{t}$ is also weakly stationary. The converse is not true in general. \n",
