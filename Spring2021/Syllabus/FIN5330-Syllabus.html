<h3 id="course-description">Course Description</h3>
<p>This course is a project-based introduction to financial data analysis. The core of the course consists of four modules each centered around a fundamental econometric method. The lectures for each module will consist of the foundational theory for the method as well as the necessary mathematical, statistical, algorithmic, and computational tools and techniques that will support its implementation for your projects.</p>
<p>The mode of the course is applied data analysis rather than theoretical econometrics. The focus is on becoming facile at implementing data analysis techniques for professional applications rather than on conducting proofs of theory for academic research. Foundational theory will be presented as necessary, but even then the focus will be on developing deep intuition and understanding more than mastering abstract mathematical techniques.</p>
<p>This course will call on you to develop three primary modes of thinking that will serve you in your career as a financial data analyst:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Arbitrage Logic:</strong> this course is first and foremost a <strong><em>finance</em></strong> course. Arbitrage is the central concept of all of economics and finance. Developing skills in arbitrage reasoning is a central goal of the course.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Computational Logic:</strong> this course takes an approach to data analysis that puts computation front and center. Developing computational skills will reinforce not only the mathematical and statistical aspects of data analysis, but also the financial aspects. Computational thinking helps break a problem down and find a practical path to successful implementation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Statistical Logic:</strong> the main focus of the course will be learning to think statistically about problems in financial data analysis. All meaningful problems in finance and data analysis are necessarily embedded in conditions of uncertainty. There exists a core statistical logic that is distinct from the mathematical logic. Learning to develop this mode of thinking is an essential step in the life of any successful financial data analyst.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>
<ul>
<li>ECN 4330 or equivalent</li>
<li><strong><em>Strong economic and statistical logic</em></strong></li>
<li>Some programming experience with R, Python, Julia, Matlab, or similar</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="textbooks">Textbooks</h3>
<p>The <em>required</em> textbooks are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/2STnGci">Scrum: The Art of Doing Twice the Work in Half the Time</a> by Jeff and J.J. Sutherland</li>
</ul>
<p>Other books that we may draw from:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/">Introduction to Statistical Learning</a> by James, Witten, Hastie, and Tibshirani.</p></li>

<h3 id="methods-of-teaching-and-learning">Methods of Teaching and Learning</h3>
<p>This course will be taught as a graduate seminar style course. That means that your participation is crucial. You will get out of the course what you individually and collectively put in.</p>
<h3 id="assessment-and-grading">Assessment and Grading</h3>
<p>Students will be assessed according to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Class Preparation, Participation and Citizenship (20%) - Much has been said about this already above. Let me just emphasize that no student can earn an A in the course who does not take this component of their grade seriously!</p></li>
<li><p>Project I (20%) - Pairs trading and statistical arbitrage</p></li>
<li><p>Project II (20%) - Volatility models and predictive densities</p></li>
<li><p>Project III (20%) - Tests of superior predictive ability (RC, SPA, StepM)</p></li>
<li><p>Project IV (20%) - Implement and test an original dynamic trading strategy</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="slack">Slack</h4>
<p>All class communication will take place using <a href="https://slack.com">Slack</a>, a messaging system that replaces email. Students will be invited to the <a href="https://fin5330.slack.com">Fin 5330 Slack channel</a> prior to the first week of class.</p>
<p>Clients for most computing and mobile platforms can be <a href="https://slack.com/downloads">downloaded from the Slack website</a>, or students may use the web client via a desktop browser.</p>
<h4 id="programming">Programming</h4>
<p>I will be presenting code in the Julia programming language throughout the course. Occasionally, I might present some code in Python or R. You are expected to complete your programming assignments and exams in one of these programming languages.</p>
<h3 id="schedule-of-topics">Schedule of Topics</h3>
<p>We will attempt to cover the following list of topics:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong><em>Module I</em></strong>: Foundations: financial data, difference equations, programming, mathematics and statistics, Monte Carlo studies</li>
<li><strong><em>Module II</em></strong>: Linear time series analysis, volatility models, unit roots and cointegration</li>
<li><strong><em>Module III</em></strong>: Multivariate time series models</li>
<li><strong><em>Module IV</em></strong>: Backtesting trading strategies, data snooping bias, and the bootstrap</li>
</ol>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong><em>NB:</em></strong> I reserve the right to dynamically alter this list as the course progresses. I will announce any such changes in class and on the course Slack channel.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Import dates:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Jan 06</strong> - First day of classes</li>
<li><strong>Mar 02 - 06</strong> - Spring break</li>
<li><strong>Apr 21</strong> - Last day of classes</li>
<li><strong>Apr 23 - Apr 29</strong> Final exams</li>
