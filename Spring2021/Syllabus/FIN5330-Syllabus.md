## Syllabus

### Course Description

This course is a project-based introduction to financial data analysis. The core of the course consists of four modules
each centered around a fundamental econometric method. The lectures for each module will consist of the foundational theory
for the method as well as the necessary mathematical, statistical, algorithmic, and computational tools and techniques that
will support its implementation for your projects. 

The mode of the course is applied data analysis rather than theoretical econometrics. The focus is on becoming facile at 
implementing data analysis techniques for professional applications rather than on conducting proofs of theory for academic
research. Foundational theory will be presented as necessary, but even then the focus will be on developing deep intuition
and understanding more than mastering abstract mathematical techniques. 

This course will call on you to develop three primary modes of thinking that will serve you in your career as a financial
data analyst:

1. __Arbitrage Logic:__ this course is first and foremost a ___finance___ course. Arbitrage is the central underlying concept
   all of economics and finance. Developing skills in arbitrage reasoning is a central goal of the course. This aspect of
   reasoning will be mainly developed by the areas of application for the projects.

2. __Computational Logic:__ this course takes an approach to data analysis that puts computation front and center. Developing
   computational skills will reinforce not only the mathematical and statistical aspects of data analysis, but also the 
   financial aspects. Computational thinking helps break a problem down and find a practical path to successful
   implementation. Important techniques from computational mathematics, computational statistics, and computational finance
   will be introduced. 

3. __Statistical Logic:__ the main focus of the course will be learning to think statistically about problems in financial
   data analysis. All meaningful problems in finance and data analysis are necessarily embedded in conditions of uncertainty.
   There exists a core statistical logic that is distinct from the mathematical. Learning to develop this mode of
   thinking is an essential step in the life of any successful financial data analyst. We will find that statistical reasoning
   is essential for proper financial reasoning. 


These three ways of thinking are not independent. Quite to the contrary, we will find that they are strongly mutually
reinforcing. 


### Prerequisites

- ECN 4330 or equivalent
- ***Strong economic and statistical logic***
- Some programming experience with R, Python, Julia, Matlab, or similar

### Textbooks

The _required_ textbooks are the following:

* [Financial Econometric Modeling]() by Hurn, 
Other books that we may draw from: 

* [Introduction to Statistical Learning][JWHT] by James, Witten, Hastie, and Tibshirani. 

* [Analysis of Financial Time Series - 3rd Edition][Tsay] by Ruey Tsay.

* [The Econometrics of Financial Markets][CLM] by Campbell, Lo, and MacKinlay.

* [Applied Econometric Time Series - 4th Edition][Enders] by Walter Enders. 


### Methods of Teaching and Learning

This course will be taught as a graduate seminar style course. That means that
your participation is crucial. You will get out of the course what you 
individually and collectively put in. 


### Assessment and Grading

Students will be assessed according to the following:

* Class Preparation, Participation and Citizenship (20%) - Much has been said about this already above. Let me just emphasize that no student can earn an A in the course who 
does not take this component of their grade seriously!

* Project I (20%) - Pairs trading and statistical arbitrage  

* Project II (20%) - Volatility models and predictive densities

* Project III (20%) - Tests of superior predictive ability (RC, SPA, StepM)

* Project IV (20%) - Implement and test an original dynamic trading strategy 


#### Slack

All class communication will take place using [Slack](https://slack.com), a messaging system that replaces email.
Students will be invited to the [Fin 5330 Slack channel](https://fin5330.slack.com) prior to the first week of
class.

Clients for most computing and mobile platforms can be
[downloaded from the Slack website](https://slack.com/downloads), or students may use the web client
via a desktop browser.


#### Programming

I will be presenting code in the Julia programming language throughout the 
course. Occasionally, I might present some code in Python or R. You are expected to 
complete your programming assignments and exams in one of these programming
languages. 


### Schedule of Topics


We will attempt to cover the following list of topics:

1. ___Module I___: Foundations: financial data, difference equations, programming, mathematics and statistics, Monte Carlo studies
2. ___Module II___: Linear time series analysis, volatility models, unit roots and cointegration 
3. ___Module III___: Multivariate time series models
4. ___Module IV___: Backtesting trading strategies, data snooping bias, and the bootstrap

***NB:*** I reserve the right to dynamically alter this list as the course progresses. I will announce any such changes in class and on the course Slack channel.

Import dates:

* __Jan 06__ - First day of classes
* __Mar 02 - 06__ - Spring break
* __Apr 21__ - Last day of classes
* __Apr 23 - Apr 29__ Final exams
