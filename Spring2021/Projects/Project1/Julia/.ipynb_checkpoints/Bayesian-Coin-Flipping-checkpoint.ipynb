    "I would like to take a step back and consider the process of Bayesian inference in a simpler model. We will first consider the simple case of flipping a coin and estimating the proportion of heads. Let $Y \\in \\{0,1\\}$ be our random variable for the outcome of a coin flip where $y = 1$ stands for heads and $y = 0$ stands for tails. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will first consider the case where we have a fair coin. That is, where $\\theta = 0.5$, and $\\theta$ is the proportion of heads in the total number of flips. By definition, each flip is independent of the last. We usually model coin flipping with the _Binomial distribution_. So we will first take some time to understand the basic details of that particular distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we are no so interested in the coin flipping problem per se, but rather are interested in it because it offers a simple setting in which to come to grips with the process of Bayesian statistical inference. Although, the binomial distribution does play an important role in finance, and coin flipping can be replaced in a more general setting for any binary outcome. Therefore, the process of statistical inference that we derive for coin flipping can apply much more broadly to more interesting questions. Here are some examples of binary random variables that we might be interested in:\n",

    "### The Beta Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, take a look at the Wikipedia article on the Beta distribution: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_distribution>\n",
    "\n",
    "The Beta distribution is expressed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p(\\theta) = Be(\\theta | a, b) = \\frac{1}{B(a,b)} \\theta^{(a - 1)} (1 - \\theta)^{(b - 1)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "for $\\theta$ in the interval $[0, 1]$ and where $B(a,b)$ is known as the _Beta Function_. See the Wikipedia article here: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_function>. This is a special function with the following property:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "B(a,b) = \\int\\limits_{0}^{1} \\theta^{(a - 1)} (1 - \\theta)^{(b - 1)} d\\theta.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In Julia the Beta function is `beta(x, y)`, and the Beta distribution is `Beta(a, b)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ___Note:___ see here for documentation on the beta function: <https://juliamath.github.io/SpecialFunctions.jl/dev/functions_list/#SpecialFunctions.beta>\n",
    "\n",
    "* ___Note:___ see here for documentation on the beta distribution: <https://github.com/JuliaStats/Distributions.jl/blob/master/src/univariate/continuous/b>\n",
    "\n",
    "___Note:___ the random variable in the Beta distribution is $\\theta$, and that $a$ and $b$ are its parameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that we can express the Beta function in terms of another special function, the _Gamma Function_ (see here: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_function>).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Gamma function can also be expressed as an integral:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\Gamma(a) = \\int\\limits_{0}^{\\infty} t^{(a - 1)} exp(-t) dt\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be shown that \n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\Gamma(a) = (a - 1)!$\n",
    "\n",
    "- $B(a,b) = \\frac{\\Gamma(a) \\Gamma(b)}{\\Gamma(a + b)}$\n",
    "\n",
    "It can also be shown that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $E(\\theta) = \\frac{a}{a + b}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The Beta distribution can generate many different shapes. Let's look at some below using some R code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start off with the case when $a = b = 1$\n",

    "We can now use this model to revise our beliefs as the data arrive (i.e. after each coin flip). This is called sequential analysis, and note that the Bayesian paradigm lends itself quite naturally to this kind of _on-line_ analysis due to the process of Bayesian updating. Whereas, in the frequentist case we have to precommit ourselves to conducting a study to flip the coin $N$ times, and then count the number of heads. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at an example. Suppose you start with the belief that $a = b = 2$. Then you observe the first flip $y = 1$ (a heads) to get $Beta(\\theta | 3, 2)$, so the mean shifts from $E(\\theta) = 2/4$ to $E(\\theta | D) = 3/5$. We see that the hyperparameters $a$ and $b$ do in fact act like \"pseudo counts\" and correspond to \"virutal\" heads or tails. We might call $n = a + b$ the effective sample size (it plays a role analogous to $N = N_{1} + N_{0}$). \n",
