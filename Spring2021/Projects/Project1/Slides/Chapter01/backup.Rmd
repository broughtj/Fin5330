# Notes on Chapter 01 - Financial Asset Prices and Returns

## Section 1.1: What is Financial Econometrics?

- No simple definition

- Data analysis for finance/economics (we will be reading Tukey's paper later)

- Empirical implementation of financial models (ex: CAPM)

- Methods of estimation and inference

- Forecasting, policy analysis, academic understanding of financial market phenomena

- Draws on finance/economics, probability, statistics, applied math

- Connections to ML & AI

- Basics: Finance Theory + Data Analysis


## Section 1.2: Financial Assets

- Fixed income

- Equity

- Derivatives

- Cash flows generated from these securities/contracts (streams of cash flows)

\vspace{10mm}

- Cash: claim on stream of services that it can secure by virtue of its role as a medium of exchange
	- Ludwig von Mises on the evolution of money
	- Cash is a kind of derivative security that derives its value from the opportunity cost of goods and services
	- Exchange rates between currencies (foreign exchange markets are the largest financial markets in the world)


## Fixed-Income Securities

- Two streams of cash flows
	- Stream of coupon payments made at regular fixed intervals
	- The eventual return of principal at maturity
	- Financial innovation is a major factor in these markets
	- (the original term fixed-income came from the simplest forms. Subsequent forms are much more sophisticated)

- Money Markets
	- Short-term, very liquid
		- Treasury bills: simplest form of government debt (3,6,9 month maturities | pure discount bonds)
	- Eurodollar deposits: deposits of US banks held in financial institutions outside the US denominated in USD.


## 

- Bond markets
	- Government bonds (e.g. US Treasury) (often zero-coupon or pure discount)
	- Corporate bonds (e.g. CAT)
		- Typically coupon-paying bonds

- Equity Securities
	- Common stock: give the owner an equity stake in the assets of the company and it's earnings
		- (call option on assets w/ K = face value of liabilities)
	- Dividends: payments representing distribution of company earnings
	- Dividend yield: $ amount per share, or as a percentage of current market price


## 

Derivative contracts

- "Derive" their value from a reference asset (called the underlying or spot)
- Payoff based on an underlying asset (commodities, stocks, interest, rates, etc)
- Two main classes:
	- (1) options: 
		- Call: the right, but not the obligation, to buy an underlying asset at a predetermined price (strike) at a predetermined time (expiry)
		- Put: the right, but not the obligation, to sell an underlying asset at a strike price at expiry
	- (2) futures: specify delivery of an asset (or cash value equivalent) at a time known as maturity for an agreed upon price (payable at maturity)
		- Long futures (person buying / taking delivery)
		- Short futures (person selling / making delivery)


## Section 1.3: Equity Prices & Returns

- Prices: represent the most basic type of data for financial econometrics
	- Quoted bid/ask prices
	- Historical transaction prices

- Frequency
	- High: intraday (sub-second time resolution)
	- Medium: daily, weekly, 
	- Low: monthly, quarterly, annual


## Hayek on the Informational Role of Prices

- AER 1945 article titled "The Use of Knowledge in Society"
- Prices convey information
	- CME closing due to flooding (grain elevators would not quote prices)
	- Roll on weather and OJ futures
	- Armen Alchian on stocks who were contractors to build the first atomic bomb


- Prices are what we want to work with, but they present very challenging statistical problems (nonstationarity)
	- Project II focuses on one particular econometric technique (cointegration and error-correction) that powerfully overcomes these problems
