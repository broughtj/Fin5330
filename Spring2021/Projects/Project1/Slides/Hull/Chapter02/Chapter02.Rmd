# Futures Market Mechanics

## Overview of Topics Discussed

\begin{itemize}
   \item Clearing houses (FCMs, brokers, etc)
   \item[]
   \item Margin accounting and marking-to-market
      \begin{itemize}
         \item Initial (original)
         \item Maintenance (variation
      \end{itemize}
   \item[]
   \item Cointegration
\end{itemize}


## Clearninghouse

\begin{itemize}
   \item Tasked with balancing all futures transactions/money flows
   \item[]
   \item Read Williams paper on \textit{Origins of Futures Markets}
   \item[]
   \item Modern futures exchange a prime example of spontaneou order
   \item[]
   \item \textbf{CH:} separate corp. or dept. associated with each exchange        
\end{itemize}

## Clearninghouse Roles

\begin{itemize}
   \item CH Roles:
      \begin{itemize}
         \item Matches and reconciles all futures transactions
         \item Assures financial integrity of transactions
         \item Provides mechanism for delivery
      \end{itemize}
   \item[]
   \item CH becomes obligor to every futures contract (reduces/manages counterparty risk)
   \item[]
   \item CH becomes party to and guarantees delivery
   \item[]
   \item Only members of exchanges can be clearing members (CM)
\end{itemize}


## Clearninghouses Continued

\begin{itemize}
   \item CMs deposit large sum of money into a guarantee fund
      \begin{itemize}
         \item usually must purchase shares of the corp.
         \item the guarantee fund is a reserve in case of trader default/bankruptcy
      \end{itemize}
   \item[]
   \item Exchange members who are not CMs must clear trades through a CM
         and pay a fee for service
   \item[]
   \item CMs are large/financially sound companies
   \item[]
   \item Maintains market stability and promotes a secure public image
\end{itemize}


## Futures Trading Mechanics

\begin{itemize}
   \item Pit trading vs LOB
   \item Traders matched through the brokers in pit, or through the LOB
   \item CH then becomes the counterparty to each futures contract
      \begin{itemize}
         \item CH is long to the shorts
         \item CH is short to the longs
         \item CH has no net position (aside from clerical errors)
            \begin{itemize}
               \item has a so-called \textit{flat book}
            \end{itemize}
      \end{itemize}
   \item This allows traders to originate and close out positions w/o search for counterparty
   \item CH transforms forward markets to be impersonal and easy to negotiate
   \item Traders can hold their positions for long durations while the otherside may turnover very often
\end{itemize}


# Margin Accounting

## Margin Accounting

\begin{itemize}
   \item CH also performs a banking function
   \item[]
   \item Every trader must have an account w/ an FCM (possibly through an IB)
   \item[]
   \item For every trade, traders must deposit money called initial (original) margin
      \begin{itemize}
         \item Serves as a performance bond
         \item Both long and short must post margin
         \item Usually around $10\%$ of position (depends on trader, and volatility of the asset)
         \item Brokers can require additional margin beyond exchange margin levels if necessary
      \end{itemize}
   \item[]
   \item After initial margin, traders must often post additional deposits to keep a minimum margin level (usually $75\%$ or $80\%$ of initial margin)
      \begin{itemize}
         \item Varies by contract (volatility)
      \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


## Margin Accounting Continued

\begin{itemize}
   \item Initial (original) and maintenance (variation) margin applies to members of the clearing corp., who in turn apply it to FCMs, and FCMs duplicate this for their customers (IBs, traders)
      \begin{itemize}
         \item FCMs only need to post on their net positions
         \item FCMs can deposit excess margin in interest bearing securities (a non-trivial source of income)
      \end{itemize}
   \item[]
   \item Margin accounting has the following functions:
      \begin{itemize}
         \item guarantee performance on futures contracts
         \item allows source of funds for daily settlement
         \item provides the financial integrity of the system
      \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


## Marking-to-Market

\begin{itemize}
   \item \textbf{Settlement price:} final price at the closing bell each day
      \begin{itemize}
         \item Each delivery month of each contract has a daily settlement price
         \item[]
         \item If a trader's position lost money for that day's trading session (depreciated in value) the CH debits the trader's account that day
         \item[]
         \item If the trader's position appreciates the CH credits the trader's account that day
         \item[]
         \item Also called \textit{collects} and \textit{pays}
         \item[]
         \item This process is called \textit{marking-to-market}
      \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


## The Economic Role of Marking-to-Market

\begin{itemize}
   \item \textbf{Q:} What economic (risk management) role does it play?
\end{itemize}


## Example: Two Traders in Corn Futures

\begin{itemize}
   \item Long/Short 5000 bushel contract at $\$2.75$ per bushel
   \item[]
   \item Initial margin: $\$2000$
\end{itemize}


## Flow of Money Between Accounts

## Margin Call

\begin{itemize}
   \item When trader's equity in margin account falls below maintenance level, she receives a margin call from her broker/FCM
\end{itemize}


## A Margin Call and Capital Withdrawal

\begin{itemize}
   \item 5000 bushel corn contract (long) at $\$2.75$ per bushel
   \item[]
   \item Maintenance margin level is $\$1,750$
   \item[]
   \item See the actual contract specs: \href{https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/agricultural/grain-and-oilseed/corn_contract_specifications.html}{CME Corn Contract Specifications}
\end{itemize}
